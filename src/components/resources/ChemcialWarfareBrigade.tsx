He is a rugged, handsome fellow, but has never been considered the brightest guy by his peers. He doesn't have many friends and spends a good deal of time drinking and fantasizing about what could have been had he decided to finish high school. Instead he dropped out so he could get a job and be a little more desirable to the very few women in the surrounding towns. Sufficed to say, many years later he is quite the opposite. He has very little actual ambition, very little money, and is extremely unsure of himself. Any time he really had had a chance with the ladies, he seemed to blow it. Meeting Shelby Rose seemed too good to be true, but he never asked thought twice when this sexy young women threw herself at him on night at Albert Lia's compound… currently out of work, hasn't had any work since he had a job doing carpentry at Albert Lai's compound a few summer back.

Everyone in town had their ideas. He has held a residence outside the town in the foothills for three years. He doesn't really seem to work or need any more money then he already has. He has what seems to the locales to be an extremely extensive security system, especially for the area, a notoriously crime free district. But he has been host to some of the greatest parties that have ever been thrown in the neighborhood, at least in Amos' memory, and there always seemed to be an abundance of alcohol and women ay his compound. Bert has numerous residences, but has spent most of his adult life running a money laundering operation out of a Newark, New Jersey restaurant called Empire Hunan, and has strong connections to organized crime families in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Chicago, and Kansas City. His compound in Tennessee was rarely used for business, rather was used as a place where he could entertain potential business associates, friends and family.`},

The Doctor hadn't been called anything but Doc or Doctor in many years. He has been a chemist for thirty years or so. He has a twenty year old son named Lukas who he hasn't seen in years. He grew despondent around five years ago when Lukas' mother, whom he had lived with for many years but never married, took Lukas and left. He transferred to the local university several years ago after many years without tenure at City College of New York. He felt that the change of scenery would be good for him as he got older and he hadn't felt better in years. He is an aloof man, whose mind is wandering in the gaseous clouds of his laboratory, even if his body is parked on a barstool at one of the several local watering holes. He doesn't really have a great deal of money, but on the other hand, he never really wanted any. But something about living in the country changed all that. Maybe it was the lack of excitement or the lack of noise, or just seeing that mansion up on the hill and wondering how much it would cost to have a place like that. He liked the country, but if he could have his way, he'd live somewhere a little warmer. He would be much better off on the beaches of a far away place like Fiji, Micronesia, or the Galapagos."},

Amy had never been the same since she had seen Silence of the Lambs so many years ago. Graduating after just seven semesters at Georgetown, she went to the FBI training center. She graduated from the training program six years earlier and qualified for undercover work when she was twenty five. After spending two six month stints living in college dormitories in similar drug stints, she was transferred to her third undercover job to the local university, where it was believed that a young man had immersed himself in a large operation of producing and distributing amphetamines. In her second month at the school, under the alias of Shelby Rose, her investigation had ended her up at Albert Lai's compound for an all night party, where rumor had it, several ounces of the unnamed drug was going to transferred from one person to another. It was at this party that she became curious that something larger then they suspected was going on in the area. The drug ring seemed to have links to several other major metropolitan areas, and she suspected possible mafia ties. It seemed that hanging around at the compound, and Bert was a sucker for having young college girls at the house, would be in her best interest."},

When the construction jobs dried up at the compound, Bert had told Amos that he could come to him if he ever needed anything. It was when he repeated himself and said emphatically, "Anything", that Amos understood. Amos always turned down Bert's offer for "legal" work. But one night at in a drunken conversation with the doctor at a local bar, Amos finds out about a chemical that the doctor is working with at the University. The research indicates that the chemical kills anything that it comes into contact with, but that it leaves virtually no trace of itself. The research project on the chemical, which the University had named Veritin-22, was originally funded to see if there could be possible uses for it as a pesticide, but the research indicates that there is no control over what it kills. It kills basically everything that it comes into contact with, and the doctor speculates in passing that even a small amount could kill a large population of buffalo, or elephants, or monkeys, or even people. And as a product of the chemical decomposition, it wouldn't leave a trace of itself. The perfect chemical weapon. They decide to have a meeting with Albert Lai to see if any of his friends could use such a powerful stealth weapon. Both of these guys need a big score. They do some simple math and realize they could potentially put hundreds of thousands of dollars in their pockets, if their consciouses could take it. And hell, to these guys, that's like millions.` },

The idea intrigued Lai and he liked the fact that a scientist was involved. Actually, his first thought was that the Doctor may be involved with the authorities, but he knew a quick background check would clear up any of his concerns. He figured that they could all make millions with his connections in China and Nicaragua, and the Doctor indicated that he could basically produce an endless supply of this as long as the "research project" continued. Lai was defiantly interested, as long as everything checked out okay. He insisted that the Doctor and Amos stick around for one of his patented shindigs, which was already going on outside the cabana at the pool. When the meeting adjourned, they allowed themselves the pleasure of a few drinks and some casual flirting with some of the local college girls.` },

Of course, the parties, although large and exciting, were invite only. Bert insisted that they meet some of the girls that were mulling around. He introduces Amos to Shelby as a business associate, which made Amos feel important. Shelby acted really interested in everything that Amos said as he was the first business associate of Lai's that she had meet who seemed vulnerable. In the two months that she had been hanging around Lai's there was never any talk of business around the ladies. Never. She couldn't seem to penetrate his business dealings, until she meet Amos. She sensed his weakness and figured she would go even deeper undercover than her job had ever required. But that was Amy, always going the extra distance, and besides, this guy actually seemed really innocent. And he was attractive. And she hadn't had any sexual relations in some time. So Amy, or Shelby as Amos knew her, engaged Amos in the time of his life. He was in love immediately. A beautiful, smart, funny girl, and she was young, and best of all, she seemed to like him. When the Doctor was passing out near the guest house, Shelby and Amos were sitting quietly by the pool getting to know each other." },

Walks in the park, hikes that led to waterfalls, and trips to the zoo packed Amos' next few days. He spent all of his free time, which was most of his time, with Shelby. He even let on to her that would take a vacation together to the islands as soon as some money came in, which would be soon. You see, the future was bright. He was nervous that she would get bored of him, and so he told her how rich he was going to be, hoping that she would stay with him. It was not before long, and not without ample prodding by Shelby that Amos told her all about the plan to make the chemical weapon and sell it and retire to the islands. The Chemical Warfare Brigade, he called the three of them. She finally had some insider information into Albert Lai's dealings. And it just so happened that her knowledge of the plan could save potentially hundreds of thousands of lives. But then the plan changed. Amos ultimately convinced Doctor Von Stadt that if they left Lai alive they would end up dead, and if they made the chemical, thousands of people would die. Amos was able to convince the Doctor that killing Lai was absolutely necessary. They could always back out, but they were already knee deep in this thing. And the truth was, however they could get the money, they would at this point. So they revamped their plan yet again. It was official. Plan B. Go in shooting, take the money, and get the hell out of there." },

As he came down the stairs, they took him out. They went up the stairs to Lai's office. Before he could even say anything, he was shot. A shootout with the three bodyguards that were remaining ensued, and Amos and the Doctor were the last men standing." },

Before Amos could even give a reason for why it was okay that he told Shelby what he was doing that evening, the Doctor, formally a meek man, turned his gun on Amos, and at once, removed his face from what was once his head. And then he started to run. He ran for his life. And as he ran, all of the facts of the story started to flash randomly through his mind. Flashbacks. He is running so hard, he starts to hallucinate. The lights are shining from the sky. There is faint screaming in the distance, and he knew that the law was on his tail. He has always stayed in good shape, but he was never prepared for this kind of a chase. The Doctor, when backed against the wall by a group of screaming agents, knows that there is only one thing that he can do. He realized that he can not live through the horror of a trial and a life in prison with a possible death penalty. He knew the truth. Death was an inevitable part of life. Everyone's time would come, and his had. He had had fantasies for many years. Big dreams. Maybe in another life. The doctor turns the gun on himself and pulls the trigger." },

			And in the thick of night,
			With not a speck of light,
			And with your fingers curled.
			<br><br>
			How did you kill your friend,
			And have you reached the end,
			Of your forsaken world.
			<br><br>
			And if you ever see me in my dreams.
			And if you know that life was what it seems.
			And now you wish that it was yesterday.
			But that's the price you have to pay.
			<br><br>
			The confrontation was a necessary act.
			We traded in our lives but took a million back.
			And in the end, it seems I get what I deserve.
			But for one moment's time, I wish I had the nerve.`

					<Paragraph>
						Chemical Warfare Brigade, Marc Brownstein’s rock opera, was first debuted by his side project Electron on 08/18/00 and then by The Disco Biscuits on 12/30/00. While a number of the songs were written during Marc’s departure from the band in 2000, Plan B (10/16/98), Three Wishes (12/03/98), Little Lai (04/21/99), and Chemical Warfare Brigade (08/21/99) were all written and debuted prior to that.
					</Paragraph>

					<Paragraph>
						Performed in full six times by TDB, the most recent occurrence was on 12/31/13 at the Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York. After the opening tracks of Plan B and Little Lai, the opera was played out of order with songs like Hot Air Balloon, House Dog Party Favor and Helicopters interwoven into the setlist.
					</Paragraph>

					<Paragraph>
						Electron also played CWB in full on 5/11/08, 05/11/13, 04/21/17, and 03/26/17.
